Nothing to serious in here, just a little game with no goal but kill the maximum of ennemies.

 A and E : rotate
 Arrows : move
 Space : Shoot
 R : Generate level
 F5 : First person (really unnecessary but hey, raycasting does look good innit ?)
 
 Windows : 
      build.bat assumes that you have %SFMLL% and %SFMLI% system variables pointing to sfml librairy and headers location.
 
 Linux
      <code>g++ src/*.cpp -o output.out -lsfml-network -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system</code>
                                             
                                             
                                                ↑
                                                
                                                
                                            Yes, useless, but yes.
